        <p> I'm a huge Avatar (not blue people) fan, Game of Thrones addict and I make a mean chocolate cake.
        I watch a bit of anime in my spare time. Some people say cartoons are childish, I think it can be motivational, thought provoking and very deep if you really think about it.
        It's also a good thing to stay young at heart.
        I also used to play badminton competitively with Canadian Junior Nationals and am a nationally certified coach.

        In high school, I was a huge science nerd
