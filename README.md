Hello world!

Welcome to the github repo of my personal website, hosted on github pages. This is the version without a blogging engine.
The other one has a jekyl-based blogging engine integrated into it, however I haven't yet written any blog posts, thus this version of the website is currently the live one.

Update: blog posts are now written on Tumblr (you can find the link by visiting this website, actually) and Medium, although all ~20 of my Medium posts remain in draft-mode. I will get to these eventually. Probably after I finish school.
